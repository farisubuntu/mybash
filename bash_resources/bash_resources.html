   <p>Learning a scripting language is an intimidating task. It also takes time because practice is the only
    way to master a skill properly, and you will need to do and redo your code to learn new techniques and
    fix your mistakes.</p>
   <p>By the end of this article, you will have:</p>
   <ul class="w3-ul">
    <li>A list of online tutorials to sharpen your skills</li>
    <li>A reference guide for Bash scripting</li>
    <li>Best practices to write code and make it more secure</li>
    <li>Resources to edit and execute Bash scripts when you don't have access to a Linux machine</li>
   </ul>
   <p>This is not a complete guide, but it will serve as a starting point to more resources.</p>
   <h2 class="w3-teal">Online tutorials</h2>
   <p>Nothing beats a detailed explanation from someone more experienced, especially if it includes examples.
    Here are some tutorials to check out:</p>
   <ul class="w3-ul">
    <li><a href="https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners" target="_blank">Bash
      scripting tutorial for beginners</a>: Linuxconfig.org's tutorial is ideal if you want to quickly
     learn the basics with examples, divided by topic.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.learnshell.org/" target="_blank">Learn Shell</a>: This interactive Shell
     Programming tutorial ranges from basic to advanced skills with lots of examples.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/topics/bash" target="_blank">Enable Sysadmin</a>: The
     website you're on has many practical articles (like this one). You may find a few of mine here, with
     <a href="https://github.com/josevnz" target="_blank">open source code</a>.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/search/?query=bash" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a>: These tutorials
     cover Bash and many other languages. Be
     prepared to spend days browsing this one.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2 class="w3-teal">Reference guide</h2>
   <p>Sometimes you want to learn how to perform a specific task without distractions. To learn the official
    way of solving things, as they say, RTFM (read the fine manual):</p>
   <ul class="w3-ul">
    <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html" target="_blank">GNU Bash reference
      manual</a>: This is the bible of Bash and includes concise examples, organized by topic. You
     will keep coming back to this guide over and over.</li>
    <li>Also, if you are on Linux, learn to use these two commands:
     <pre class="w3-card"><code># 'The GNU Bash Reference Manual', for 'Bash'
        info bash</code></pre>
     <p>And:</p>
     <pre class="w3-card"><code># bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell
        man bash</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://opensource.com/downloads/bash-scripting-ebook?intcmp=701f20000012ngPAA" target="_blank">A
        sysadmin's guide to Bash scripting</a>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2 class="w3-teal">Check your Bash code</h2>
   <p>You want to learn how to write efficient code, avoid common mistakes, and make sure your scripts are
    secure. Fear not, there are plenty of resources out there to learn basic and advanced skills, including:
   </p>
   <ul class="w3-ul">
    <li><a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck" target="_blank">ShellCheck</a>: I recommend
     installing this shell script static analysis tool. You can use it online, but its true power comes
     when you integrate it with <a href="https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/beginners-guide-vim" target="_blank">Vim</a> or
     IntelliJ IDE. You may wonder how you managed to live without it for
     so long.</li>
    <li><a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Command_Injection" target="_blank">OWASP command
      injection page</a>: Command injection is commonly used to elevate privileges on scripts or
     programs that do not sanitize user input. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an
     international nonprofit that tracks security vulnerabilities to help people avoid repeating them. I
     find it helpful to be familiar with this list of risks, like the infamous <a
      href="https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/Shellshock_-_Tudor_Enache.pdf" target="_blank">Shellshock</a>, so I don't
     repeat them in my scripts.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2 class="w3-teal">Code repositories</h2>
   <p>The following repositories contain Bash scripts written so that you can learn specific topics by checking
    the code. All the code is open source, and you can copy and paste the examples to learn.</p>
   <ul class="w3-ul">
    <li><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Complete-Bash-Shell-Scripting-" target="_blank">Complete
      Bash shell scripting</a>: This is a nice code repository published by Packt with examples
     organized by topic.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/jayant2014/Bash-Scripting" target="_blank">Udemy practice script
      repository</a>: What could be better than learning about Bash programming by example? This
     repository from Udemy's course on shell scripting is nicely organized by topic. Each script topic is
     small and self-describing.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Md-MamunAbdulKayum/shell-scripting-examples"
      target="_blank">shell-scripting-examples</a>: This is a cookbook of common tasks in Bash (like
     reading from a property file or accessing a MySQL database). These examples are well worth checking
     out.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Keep in mind that code in repositories like GitHub may contain bugs. Also, be very careful not to
    download and run code as the superuser, or you may find yourself in a pickle.</p>
   <h2 class="w3-teal">Run code online</h2>
   <p>What if you want to try something but you don't have access to Linux or Unix? This is less than ideal,
    but you can try a few online resources with very nice front ends to run your scripts, such as:</p>
   <ul class="w3-ul">
    <li><a href="https://www.mycompiler.io/new/bash" target="_blank">MyCompiler.io</a>: This site provides
     syntax support, lets you run code from your browser, and supports multiple languages. It's very
     convenient, especially if you don't have access to Linux to test a simple script</li>
    <li><a href="https://rextester.com/l/bash_online_compiler" target="_blank">Bash online compiler</a>: You
     can run Bash scripts directly from your browser, with a few restrictions, on this site. It also has
     good syntax color support.</li>
    <li><a href="https://leetcode.com/playground/new/empty" target="_blank">LeetCode</a>: This site has a
     nice playground where you can write scripts in Bash (and many other languages). If you want, you can
     try to solve some of its challenges (with paid and free subscription options).</li>
   </ul>

   </aside>
   <p class=" w3-border w3-border-lime">These online resources can help you become a better Bash programmer. Some other things to keep in mind:
   </p>
   <ul class="w3-ul">
    <li>Learn basic concepts by looking at the online tutorials but always check the reference guides. They
     are the most trustworthy (well, almost always).</li>
    <li>Avoid common mistakes by checking the ShellCheck and OWASP websites. You will thank yourself later.
    </li>
    <li>Learn by example by looking at how others solve common problems (in places like GitHub). Also, if
     you find a bug, contribute and report it or, even better, submit a patch.</li>
    <li>Don't forget that practice is the best way to learn something, so go ahead and start writing a few
     scripts!</li>
